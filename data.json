    "problem_statement": "As organizations increasingly adopt remote and hybrid work models, traditional collaboration tools such as video conferencing, shared screens, and chat platforms fail to provide presence, spatial understanding, and experiential learning. This limitation is especially critical in domains such as engineering training, medical simulation, industrial operations, disaster response, and complex system design, where hands-on experience and spatial awareness are essential. XR (Extended Reality), which includes Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR), offers the potential to create immersive environments where users can collaborate, train, and simulate real-world scenarios. However, most existing XR platforms are proprietary, hardware-locked, and difficult to scale or customize. They often lack real-time multi-user synchronization, enterprise-grade security, and integration with existing digital systems. There is a need for an open-source, cloud-native XR platform that enables real-time immersive collaboration and simulation, supports distributed users, integrates intelligent guidance, and operates across heterogeneous devices while preserving privacy and scalability.",
    "expected_solutions": "Participants must design and implement an XR-based immersive platform that functions as a shared virtual workspace or simulation environment. The system should allow multiple users to enter a shared immersive space where they can interact with virtual objects, environments, and each other in real time. These interactions must be synchronized with low latency to ensure a consistent shared experience, even when users are geographically distributed. The platform should support scenario-based simulations such as training workflows, operational procedures, or collaborative design reviews. These scenarios must be dynamically configurable and capable of responding to user actions in real time. The solution should also integrate intelligent assistance, such as AI-driven guidance, contextual prompts, or adaptive difficulty levels, to enhance learning and decision-making. From a systems perspective, the platform must be cloud-native, enabling session management, state synchronization, and scalability for multiple concurrent XR sessions. Privacy and safety considerations must be addressed, ensuring that user data, motion tracking, and interaction logs are handled securely and ethically.
